     <h1>Closure</h1>
     <p>One of Gestalt's principles is that of closure. According to White Space is not Your Enemy, "We mentally fill in the gaps in order to complete a perceived shape."(page 62)</p>
       <p>This principle means that a designer can get an audience to see a shape that isn't entirely outlined. The brain will fill in the parts that naturally would occur to form the shape. By using this principle, a designer does not need to exactly outline a shape they'd like to portray. Leaving gaps can add more interest and keep the viewer engaged.</p>
    
    <figure>
     <img src="closure.jpg" class="responsive" alt="A circle that is mostly complete, with a few gaps"/>
     <figcaption>This picture illustrates the principle by showing how a shape with missing parts will be completed in someone's head.
     </figcaption>
   </figure>
       
       <p>For example, in the drawing above, the circle has missing parts, but any reader can tell that it is a circle. This strategy could be applied to logos and advertising, or even works of art. It makes a basic shape more unique and gives it a way to stand out. </p>
