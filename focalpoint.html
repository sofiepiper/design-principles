     <h1>Focal Point</h1>
       <p>White Space is not your enemy describes focal point as "the most important thing visually on any layout." It also says, "Sometimes called the principle of emphasis, the focal point is the center of attention in the design or layout."(page 53)</p>
       <p>This means the focal point is going to be the first thing an audience sees when looking at a design. It is the center focus of the entire design, and should be the thing that draws an audience's eye in. This is why it is so important, without it, there is nothing to draw initial attention to the design.</p>

     <img src="focalpoint.jpg" class="responsive" alt="A wine bottle sits against a cream backdrop. The wine bottle has a large apple in the center of the label"/>
     <figcaption>This bottle has a large apple as its focal point.
        </figcaption>
   </figure>
       <p>Most labels, flyers and ads will have a focal point. In the image above, it is the apple in the center of the label. It is the thing that draws your attention to a new, tasty snack being sold at the grocery store. It is the appealing image or logo that draws you to an event flyer. Each time your attention is drawn to some sort of design, you can likely find a focal point that drew the attention.</p>
