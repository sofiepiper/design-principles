     <h1>Balance</h1>
     <p>According to White Space is not Your enemy, "In design, we think of balance in form of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radial, symmetrical and asymmetrical."(page 56)</p>
       <p>Radial balance refers to circular balance starting from the center, and results in two symmetrical halves when cut in half in any way. An example could be a snowflake. With its radial balance, a snowflake's sides will be identical no matter which direction you slice it in half. Symmetrical balance refers to each side of design mirroring the other. Not to be confused with radial balance, symmetrical balance only produces identical sides when cut in half a certain way. Asymmetry does the opposite, and results in two different sides when the design is cut in half in any way.</p>

           <img src="balance2.jpg" class="responsive" alt="a circular pink flower with green foliage in the background"/>
           <figcaption> This flower presents a real-world example of natural symmetrical balance.</figcaption>

    <figure>
     <img src="balance.jpg" class="responsive" alt="A bulletin board with papers placed on it asymmetrically"/>
     <figcaption>This board is an example of asymmetrical balance.

       <p> To give context, think about the front of a car. A car has two headlights on either side, usually a grill in the front, and two rearview mirrors on either side. Most every car you see will fit this form of symmetry. By doing this, car designers make customers comfortable by providing an attractive product that meets customer's expectations, as they know both sides will look the same. This is just one example of balance, others can be found all over in your day-to-day life. Think about which balance you use when designing an image or shape. You can vary your balance depending on how you want your viewer to feel. Asymmetry can bring a more comfortable feeling, while symmetry and radial balance make the viewer more comfortable.</p>
