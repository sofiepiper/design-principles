     <h1>Movement</h1>
     <p>White Space is not Your Enemy explains movement like this: "The principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design controls the eye's flow through the composition. The flow of lines can move the eye across the page or screen. Lines, then, can create movement, and different kinds of linear movement tend to communicate different kinds of symbolic messages."(pages 57-58)</p>
       <p>Movement is another principle that can be seen in any design, whether there is a little or a lot. A designer should use lines to lead the movement of the reader's eyes to where they want them to go. Symbolically, going upward could convey moving up in the world, lines that go around a curve could indicate travel, or a company that goes the distance for its customers. Paying attention to movement can help a reader understand what kind of message the designer is trying to convey. </p>

     <p>Movement can convey many messages. Today, many car ads will have many moving lines to convey speed. Another example would be the circular movement of a recycling logo to indicate the circle of life trash can go through, and repetition. Any designer can use movement to enhance their work, if only they think critically about where and how to apply it.</p>
