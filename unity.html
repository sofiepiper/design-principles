     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p>White Space is not Your Enemy has a very simple definition for unity. It states: "Unity means that all the parts of the design work together, and everything looks like it belongs together."(page 60)</p>
       <p>This is a very simple principle to understand. Things should coordinate. A dark and gloomy theme on a movie flyer wouldn't use a bubble letter font for the title. When the aspects of your design coordinate, it gives the appearance of a well-planned, well focused design.</p>

     <img src="unity.jpg" class="responsive" alt="A flyer advertising a meet and greet for the council of writing program administrators. It is grey and burgundy. There are several rectangles on the flyer with information inside, all similar in shape, and formed in a simple style."/>
     <figcaption>This flyer shows unity by making all of its blocks in the coordinating colors, styles, and shapes.

       <p>An application of this could be an ad for a punk rock concert. Punk rock is meant to be tough and dark, so one could assume the majority of the flyer would have bold black font. If this was true, using pink cursive font for one of the headings would be breaking unity. A designer would want to continue the use of something bold and dark for their headings to maintain the unity of their work.</p>
