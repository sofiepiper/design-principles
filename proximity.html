     <h1>Proximity</h1>
     <p>In White Space is not Your Enemy, proximity is explained like this: "We percieve objects that are close together as belonging to the same group...Placing elements in proximity to one another goes back to clumping. The idea is to avoid a busy, cluttered layout by physically grouping items that belong together."(page 60)</p>
       <p>This means a designer will place objects together when they want the audience to associate them as together. If an audience sees many things together in one place on a page or screen, they will assume that they go together. This also helps to organize the items in a design.</p>

     <figcaption>In this flyer, each idea is placed together, with locations on the right and information on the left.

       <p>To illustrate this, think of an ad for a music festival. The important, or opening, acts are grouped together and listed first, which lets the listener know that those are the most important acts. Next, the smaller acts are listed and grouped together. The audience will assume that something in the second group belongs in that category, even if it isn't specified. The rest of the ad will go on this way, that way even if the audience doesn't know the names of all the artists performing, they can differentiate between the smaller and bigger ones based on them being grouped together.</p>
