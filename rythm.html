     <h1>Rhythm</h1>
     <p>Our book, White Space is not Your Enemy says that "A pattern, whether regular or irregular, also may create a sort of movement we could call rhythm...In graphic design, rhythmic movement has to do with repeating items strategically-kind of like a backbeat."(page 59)</p>
       <p>This is saying that patterns can give audiences a certain expectation and sense of continuity in a design. Repeating a font will give the audience something to expect and satisfy that expectation when it's met. Rhythm gives a sense of togetherness and organization to a work, while also making it easier for the reader to continue reading.</p>

     <figcaption>The pages of this book have a certain rhythm because of their sameness in font style and size.

       <p>To apply this to the world around us, we can think about something as simple as a page in a book. The book likely will have the same font all the way through, giving it rhythm and keeping the reader's focus. If the fonts changed in size or style, the reading would appear disjointed. By applying a rhythm to the things we design, we can ensure that we hold the readers focus and establish a sense of flow.</p>
