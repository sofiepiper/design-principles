     <h1>Contrast</h1>
     <p>White Space is not Your Enemy says, "Contrast is an important principle for designing interesting (as opposed to boring) layouts. Contrast, as a principle, offers a great deal of flexibility. There are limitless ways to achieve it."(page 56)</p>
       <p> This is essentially saying that contrast is not a principle that can only be applied in certain situations. A designer can contrast color, lines, texture, or any other aspect of the design. It is used to give the audience something more interesting and dynamic to look at.</p>

     <figcaption>The yellow in the flower contrasts against the bright green background.

       <p>In the world around us, we see contrast everywhere. Some contrast occurs naturally, such as the pink of a flower petal against the green leaves of the plant. Other contrast is man-made. Think of the contrasting yellow and red colors of your favorite junk food joint, or the bold color blocking clothing trend seen all over Instagram and the fashion world. Contrast is applied just about everywhere as of current.</p>
